Manual:
    I interpreted the colour of new blocks as below:

    When adding colour on a cell with at least one block,
    I use the current colour of the blocks on the cell. When
    adding colour on a cell with no blocks, I use the colour
    selected by radio button. This means, if the radio selected
    colour is RED, and I'm on a cell with BLUE blocks, pressing
    SPACE will add a BLUE block, but if you keep pressing BACKSPACE
    until there are no more blocks left on the cell, then you press
    SPACE, it will add a RED( not BLUE ).
